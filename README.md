<p align="center">👋 Hello, I'm Hadrien, Full Stack JS Web Developer Junior from Pau, France. I am specialized in Data with the creation of REST APIs with NodeJS and i am currently learning REACT.<p>

  ## Story
  I've been coding since I was 12 years old but I went to business school and never really pushed a particular language. I particularly studied pentesting and I learned a lot    about linux environment and how the network works at that time. I manage a dedicated server on which I have all my cloud services and where I can deploy web applications.
  
  Now I decided to work in the field I like and I did a retraining as a full stack javascript developer.
  
  Since 2016 I'm particularly following the world of crypto-currencies in parallel with the pentesting world that I still love.
  During my training I chose the Back End speciality and I am currently learning REACT. Afterwards I plan to continue to train on the technologies I have learned and start to see other languages like Python.
